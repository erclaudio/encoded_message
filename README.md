Algoritm designed to decode a secret message from a text file input in the following format:
1 word1
2 word2
...  ...
To decode a message we arrange the number in a traingle shape and the number on right side of the triangle corresponds to the correct word in the message:
1
2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9  10
...  ...  ...

In this case the correct words of the message will be the ones corresponding to numbers 1,3,6,10 and so on depending on the input.
